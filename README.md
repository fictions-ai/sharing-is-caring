# Sharing-Is-Caring

Welcome to the `sharing-is-caring` repository! ðŸŽ‰

## Introduction

This repository is maintained by the **fictions.ai** team. We believe in the power of collaboration and the magic that happens when we share knowledge. Here, we'll be sharing our workflow, useful scripts, and tools related to A.I. generation.

## VERY IMPORTANT

**SAVE THE WORKFLOW IMAGE ON YOUR PC AND DRAG IT TO COMFYUI, IT'LL LOAD THE WORKFLOW. DON'T RECREATE IT MANUALLY :)**
